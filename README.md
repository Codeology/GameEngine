# GameEngine | Codeology Spring 2021 Project
### Project Leader: Ethan Chen
### Developers: tbd

## Note: project is still in development 

## Quick Overview 
In this project, we're here to learn C++. Using the language, we are going to build a game engine. What is a game engine? It basically lays the software framework to build and run video games. As a result, our engine needs to be able to render graphics, detect and manage collisions between on-screen objects, memory management and more. Hence, accurately implementing fundamental physics principles and efficient game engine performance are our two key goals. From there, we can go on to build whatever game we like! (Nothing too complicated though) 

## Required software: 
- VS Code (code editor for C++ that we will be using) 

## Learning Resources
Learning resources for C++ and other parts of the project can be found on this Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10BjgtN72MlKrD2B87_pIJL2mDXbkzUVO?usp=sharing

We will also be using this Bank System, coded in C++, that is written by cppforschool.com for practice using c++. It has been edited by us (at Codeology), but full credit goes to cppforschool.com for developing and sharing the project's code.
