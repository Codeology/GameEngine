## Quick Overview 
In this project, we're here to learn C++. Using the language, we are going to build a game engine. What is a game engine? It basically lays the software framework to build and run video games. As a result, our engine needs to be able to render graphics, detect and manage collisions between on-screen objects, memory management and more. Hence, accurately implementing fundamental physics principles and efficient game engine performance are our two key goals. From there, we built a simple game, based on the classic childhood Snake Game (or more recently, like slither.io). 

## Required software: 
- Visual Studio Code (for Windows users)
- Any code editors for Mac users (Makefiles are included for OpenGL setup) 

## Learning Resources
Learning resources for C++ and other parts of the project can be found on this Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10BjgtN72MlKrD2B87_pIJL2mDXbkzUVO?usp=sharing

We will also be using this Bank System, coded in C++, that is written by cppforschool.com for practice using c++. It has been edited by us (at Codeology), but full credit goes to cppforschool.com for developing and sharing the project's code.

## Primary Technologies Used
- C++
- OpenGL (a.k.a. GLFW library in C++) for various tools for handling input, output vectors etc.
